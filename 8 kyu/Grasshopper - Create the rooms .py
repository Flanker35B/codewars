https://www.codewars.com//kata/56a29b237e9e997ff2000048
Task: You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains 
all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three 
properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

          "room2":{"name": "r2", "square" : 5, "description" : "dining room"}, 
          "room3":{"name": "r3", "square" : 8, "description" : "bedroom"}}
